Introducation
=============

The main goal of the Firefly framework is to provide a top-level 2D game API that comes with an in-build Component-Entity-System architecture to organize 
all the game-objects, data and assets in a well-defined form and helps a lot on keeping the game code-base as flexible as possible for changes. 

Since almost everything in Firefly is a component, to create them is following always the very same principle with a builder DSL 
while business-code stays in their System(s). This leads to more flexibility when content or behavior must be changed or need to be extended. 

Firefly also intent to be as less restrictive as possible to make it easy to extend functionality and integrate other libraries. 
Firefly shall help you with that and not strain you with rigid conventions.
