Welcome to Firefly FlyKoLib documentation!
==========================================

***Firefly*** and its Kotlin implementation ***FlyKoLib*** is a top-level 2D game framework. Focusing on intuitive API and build within stringent architecture and design principles like Component-Entity-System, Builder/DSL and component indexing for fast access.

The main goal of ***Firefly*** is to provide a top-level 2D game API that comes with an in-build Component-Entity-System architecture helping to organize all the game-objects, data and assets in a well-defined form. It also helps a lot on keeping the game code-base as flexible as possible for changes. Since almost everything in Firefly is defined as a component, to create them following always the very same builder DSL while business-code stays in their System(s). This leads to more flexibility when content or behavior must be changed or need to be extended. Firefly also intent to be as less restrictive as possible to make it easy to integrate other libraries or just go your own path in particular if you want to do so. Firefly shall help you with that and not strain you with rigid conventions.
